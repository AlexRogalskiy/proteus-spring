In the previous section we covered, how to import required dependencies in order to set
up quickly Netifi Spring Boot Application. In turn, we have seen what mandatory
properties are in the Netifi Spring Boot Starter.

In this section we are going to cover how to create a complete Spring Boot based
Netifi application.

Assume we have a configured dependencies on the Netifi Spring Boot Starter, so now we
are going to configure a server that drains data from the remote server.

Also, assume that we have a configured IDL service, so we may use interfaces from it.
