In the previous section we covered, how to import required dependencies in order to set
up quickly Proteus Spring Boot Application. In turn, we have seen what mandatory

In this section we are going to cover how to create a complete Spring Boot based

are going to configure a server that drains data from the remote server.

Also, assume that we have a configured IDL service, so we may use interfaces from it.
