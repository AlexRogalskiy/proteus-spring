= Quick Start with Proteus Spring module


In this section we are going to learn how to bootstrap Proteus Spring Boot Application.

As the first step of any applications setup is generating the base application. For
that purpose we may use http://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].

Once the base application is generated or there is an existing one, use the following
dependency on the Proteus Spring Boot Starter:

[subs=attributes+]
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile "io.netifi.proteus:proteus-spring-boot-starter:{appversion}"
}
----

The above code-snippet shows how we may bring required dependencies in to our Gradle
based Spring Boot Application.

In the case of the Maven build-tool, the dependency on the starter is the following:

[subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netifi.proteus</groupId>
    <artifactId>proteus-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>{appversion}</version>
</dependency>
----
